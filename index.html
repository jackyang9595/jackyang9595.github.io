						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						</div>
						<p><strong>The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease has been spread worldwide resulting in an unprecedented health crisis in the past year. To prevent COVID-19, there has been research on various types of vaccines including viral vector, protein subunit, inactivated virus, and nucleic acid-based vaccines since April 2020. The vaccines approved by the US FDA EUA are Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19, Moderna COVID-19, and Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, of which two are mRNA-based and the other relies on an adenovirus vector to transfer the viral genetic materials into the host cells.</strong></p> 
						<p><strong>On 18 February, the Hong Kong government announced the arrangement for COVID-19 vaccination program and had purchased three types of vaccines including inactivated vaccine (Sinovac, China), mRNA vaccine (BioNTech, Germany), and non-replicating viral vector vaccine (AstraZeneca, Oxford, UK). As of 4 April 2021, there were more than 556,100 vaccine recipients of which 1,357 cases reported physical unwellness after vaccination. However, a total of 15 deaths have been reported after the injection of vaccines since the commencement of the program on 26 February 2021. Of the 15 deaths aged between 55 to 80 years old, two recipients were chronically ill, and one did not have recent medical history. The news promptly diminished public confidence and willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccines consequently hampering the progress of disease prevention despite that there was no direct evidence of the causality between the deaths and injection of the vaccines so far. Hence, more data and research are urgently needed to re-assure the impacts and effectiveness of the vaccines on young adults, middle-aged adults, elderly, and chronic patients.</strong></p> 
						<p><strong>Furthermore, the duration of immunogenic protection elicited by the vaccines is still unknown. Re-vaccination may be necessary to maintain immunity against SARS-CoV-2 annually, warranting a need for investigation of long-term immunogenicity of the vaccines for future disease prevention and policy formulation. To this end, our study aims to investigate the prevalence and severity of side effects in vaccinated adults, immunological protection correlates and duration against prototypic and variant SARS-CoV-2 strains. The anticipated outcomes of our study are:</strong></p>
						<li><strong><i>a. To rebuild confidence in public in COVID-19 vaccination</i></strong></li>
						<li><strong><i>b. To contribute data to the society regarding vaccine immunogenicity</i></strong></li>
						<li><strong><i>c. To provide results on protection duration which needs to be known to prepare for future disease prevention and control</i></strong></li>

						<h2>Here are our studies</h2>
					</div>
					<h3>Study population</h3>
					<p><strong>We target any vaccinated or unvaccinated participants aged 18 or above in Hong Kong, regardless of their race, gender, or occupation. We will distribute a survey that obtains respondents’ particulars including age, gender, and COVID-19 vaccination history from April to July 2021. We anticipate a total of 100-200 participants to be enrolled in the serological tests with no less than 30 for each age cohort defined below: </strong></p>
					<li><strong><i>Elderly</i> refers to adults aged 65 or above.</strong></li>
					<li><strong><i>Middle-aged adults</i> refer to adults aged 30 to 64.</strong></li>
					<li><strong><i>Young adults</i> refer to adults aged between 18 to 29.</i></strong></li>
					<p></p>
					<h3>Patient and public involvement</h3>
					<p><strong>We will communicate with the HKUST clinic to assist with blood sample collection from the participants who are willing to take the blood tests. Each participant will be notified one week prior to the date of visit to the clinic for blood drawing. The blood collection procedures will be explained to each participant and an informed consent form will need to be signed by both the research assistant and the participant beforehand. The email-attached consent form will ensure our research process is transparent to the persons involved in our research and will obtain consent from the participants for personal data/information collection.</strong></p>
					<p><strong>After each blood test, participants should receive a blood test report within a week after their visit to the clinic. The blood report will answer the following questions:</strong></p>
					<li><strong>(1)	Seropositivity: Is the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody present in your blood?</li></strong>
					<li><strong>(2)	Antibody concentration: How much of this antibody is present in your blood?</li></strong>
					<li><strong>(3)	Immunogenic protection: Whether you are protected by the vaccine you received from COVID-19 and its variants</li></strong>
					<p></p>
					<h3>Blood sample collection</h3>
					<p><strong>A total of 3-4 serological tests will be given to each participant depending on whether they have received the first dose or not. For individuals vaccinated at least once, they should expect to take the blood test 28 days after injection of the first dose, 2-3 weeks after the second dose (maximum antibody concentration), and 6 months after their second dose. For unvaccinated individuals, they should expect to take the blood test in the same manner except there will be one extra test before their first vaccination. Notification will be sent via email to the participant a week before the serological test. Serological test one year after the second dose may be required depending on the participation rate and previous test results. </strong></p>
					<p><strong>Participants who agree to take a serological test will need to visit the university clinic for blood collection. Each collection will draw 2.5-10 mL of whole blood from their vein. All collected blood samples will be stored at 4-8ºC and tested within 24 hours in our research laboratory.</strong></p>
